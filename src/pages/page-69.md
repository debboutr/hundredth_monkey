## <span style="font-size:47px;">T</span>hey told the Joint Committee an Atomic Energy:
> ### When we first joined the General Electric Nuclear Energy Division, we were very excited about the idea of this new technology -- atomic power -- and the promise of a virtually limitless source of safe, clean and economic energy for this and future generations. But now...the promise is still unfulfilled. The nuclear industry has developed to become an industry of narrow specialists, each promoting and refining a fragment of the technology, with little comprehension of the total impact on our world system...We [resigned] because we could no longer justify devoting our life energies to the continued development and expansion of nuclear fission power -- a system we believe to be so dangerous that it now threatens the very existence of life on this planet.
