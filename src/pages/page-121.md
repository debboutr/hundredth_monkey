## <span style="font-size:47px;">H</span>owever much our ideas and ideologies may clash, we must remember that nothing is more important for survival and for happiness in life than feelings of understanding and commonness of human purpose.
## All of the nations on earth are acting like spoiled children who are fighting over marbles.
## Children forget that their happiness comes not from possession of the marbles, but from the fun of playing together -- and from creating the great adventure of life together.
