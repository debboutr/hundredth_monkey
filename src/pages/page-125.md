## <span style="font-size:47px;">L</span>et's not ruin our future because of anything in the past.

*Bernard Benson in _The Peace Book_ (Bantam Books, 1982) gives a sensitive new angle by letting a child ask the pertinent questions and give practical solutions. Philip Noel Baker (Co-Chariman of the World Disarmament Campaign and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize) said, "Everyone who wants to live should read this book." It has been translated to Russian and the author was interviewed by children on TV in Moscow.
