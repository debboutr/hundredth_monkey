## <span style="font-size:47px;">T</span>hen something startling took place. In the autumn of 1958, a certain number of Koshima monkeys were washing sweet potatoes -- the exact number is not known.

## Let us suppose that when the sun rose one morning that there were 99 monkeys on Koshima Island who had learned to wash their sweet potatoes.

## Let's further suppose that later that morning, the hundredth monkey learned to wash potatoes.

## THEN IT HAPPENED!
