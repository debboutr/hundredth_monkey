## <span style="font-size:47px;">T</span>he council for a Livable World has pointed out that military expenditures of themselves are destructive to human life -- even if the weapons they stockpile are never used.*
*The Council for a Livable World was founded in 1962 by the eminent nuclear physicist Dr. Leo Szillard to combat the menace of nuclear war and strengthen national security through rational arms control. The Council continues to pursue its objectives by blending the resources of its knowledgeable scientists with the skills of practical politics, and by concentrating its efforts on the U.S. Senate which has unique advise and consent powers in foreign affairs. You may help by sending a contribution to Council for a Livable World, 11 Beacon Street, Boston, MA 02108.
