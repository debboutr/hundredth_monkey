## <span style="font-size:47px;">R</span>ear Admiral LaRocque warns us:
> ### It's very important for all of us today to realize that the Soviet Union is not the enemy. Nuclear war is the enemy. We're going to have to learn to live with the Russians or we and the Russians are going to die at about the same time.
## So urgent is the situation that we must shortcut through our usual ways of thinking.
# Humanity and world peace must be given priority above everything else.
*Rear Admiral LaRocque is now the Director of the Center For Defense Information, 303 Capital Gallery West, 600 Maryland Ave., S.W., Washington, D.C. 20024.
