## <span style="font-size:47px;">T</span>he mind can be trained to nurture a "me-and-you" consciousness in which patience and understanding well compassionately harmonize the flow of our activities so that we all want to help each other work things out.
## We can develop an awareness that things aren't problem-free for me until they're problem-free for you!
## This applies equally to relationships between individuals or between countries.
