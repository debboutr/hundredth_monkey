## <span style="font-size:47px;">T</span>his does not necessarily mean leaving your work or your present lifestyle.
## It means giving an increasing energy and priority to expanding your own awareness, to communicating with other people who are now asleep, and to withdrawing energy from all thoughts and actions which create human alienation, separateness, destruction and death.*
*Green ribbons were worn as a reminder of the children being killed in Atlanta. Yellow ribbons were worn as a reminder that our citizens were being held as hostages in Iran. There is a worldwide energy to wear blue ribbons symbolizing that everyone on earth is a hostage to the everpresent threat of nuclear annihilation. You may wish to buy a roll of 3/8" blue ribbon and a package of safety pins and pass out these symbols of protest to your friends -- and wear one yourself. Thousands of people in Europe are wearing leaves as Friends of the _Peace Book_ by Bernard Benson.
