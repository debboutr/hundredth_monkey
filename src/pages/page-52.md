## <span style="font-size:47px;">"N</span>uclear war," according to Roger Fisher, Professor of Law at Harvard, "is not a solution. It is worse than any problem it might 'solve.'"
## An all-out nuclear war between the U.S. and Russia could kill hundreds of people and subject the survivors to radiation sicknesses -- and cause countless mutations of the genetic blueprints of our species.*
*If our nuclear insanity continues, our great-grandchildren may be so mutated that they cannot even be classified as members of our species, _Homo sapiens_.
