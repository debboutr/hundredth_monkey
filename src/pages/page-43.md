## <span style="font-size:47px;">O</span>ne million tons of TNT is known as a megaton. A grand total of over three megatons of nonnuclear explosives were used in World War II from 1941 to 1945.
## Today, nuclear bombs up to 20 megatons each are poised for action.
## Only one of these could destroy a large city and make the land dangerous for eons!
## Even larger nuclear warheads are on the drawing boards!
