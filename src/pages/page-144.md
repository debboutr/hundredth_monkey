## <span style="font-size:47px;">T</span>he strength of our species lies not in sharp fangs or piercing claws.
## It lies in our ability to use our minds to cooperate with each other as we play the games of life.
## The same powerful minds that created nuclear bombs and intercontinental missiles can also learn how to create human unity and cooperativeness.
## We <u>can</u> save the world from people-made disaster -- when we set the goal high and add our determination and our persistence.
