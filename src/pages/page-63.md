## <span style="font-size:47px;">C</span>arl Sagan, professor of astronomy at Cornell University and creator of the "Cosmos" series, said:
> ### What a waste it would be after 4 billion tortuous years of evolution if the dominant organism contrived its own self-destruction. We are the first species to have devised the means. There is no isse more important than the avoidance of nuclear war. It is incredible for any thinking person not to be concerned with this issue. No species is guaranteed tenured life on this planet. We are privileged to be alive and to think. We have the privilege to affect the future.
