## <span style="font-size:47px;">T</span>he failure of a 46Â¢ computer part has produced a false signal that Russian missiles were on the way.
## On November 9, 1979, a reportedly fail-safe computer responded to a war games tape by turning on all American early warning systems around the world!
## On June 3 and again on June 6, 1980, computer arrors in our warning system began a rapid chain of events that could have ruined the planet.
## You and I may have been only minutes from nuclear death when these technical errors were spotted!!!*
*Military folks will protest that, while true, the above are unfair statements. They haven't blown us apart yet, have they?
