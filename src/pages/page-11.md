## <span style="font-size:47px;">T</span>he Japanese monkey, _Macaca fuscata_, has been observed in the wild for a period of over 30 years.

## In 1952, on the island of Koshima scientists were providing monkeys with sweet potatoes dropped in the sand. The monkeys liked the taste of the raw sweet potatoes, but they found the dirt unpleasant.
