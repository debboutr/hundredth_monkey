## <span style="font-size:47px;">W</span>hen we even maintain a supply of nuclear bombs as a "deterrent," we are dangerously perpetuating the illusion that our safety and security lie in nuclear materials.
## Such a consciousness makes inevitable the competitive stockpiling and future use of these materials.
## And the passions of many military and political leaders and terrorists are such that sooner or later they will unleash every bit of destructiveness they can get their hands on!
