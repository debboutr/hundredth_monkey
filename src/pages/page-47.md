## <span style="font-size:47px;">D</span>avid Hoffman points out, "In nuclear war, the best defense is not to have an offense."*
## War no longer functions for settling disputes between nations.
## War itself must be abolished in the twentieth century -- just as slavery was eliminated during the nineteenth century.
## Our survival demands new ways of operating our civilization!
* David Hoffman is the co-founder of "Interhelp," Box 331, Northampton, MA 01061, a think tank focusing on practical ways to get us out of out nuclear predicament.
