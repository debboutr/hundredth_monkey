## <span style="font-size:47px;">W</span>hatever we expect to get by creating hatred and separateness even if "justified" is always purchased at far too great a price.
## Human love -- our heart-to-heart love -- is more valuable than anything else.
## If we have this, we have enough.
## Without this love in our hearts, nothing else will be enough!
