## <span style="font-size:47px;">I</span>f you have less exposure to this deadly radioactivity, you may develop leukemia in five years.

## Hiroshima survivors were thirty times more likely to have this fatal disease that the unexposed population!*

*Between 1945 and 1963 several hundred thousend soldiers were marched through areas where the Nevada atomic weapons tests were conducted. The rate of leukemia among these men had been 400 times the national average! _Shut Down_, p. 165.
*A battery operated geiger counter that will alert you to nuclear radiation is available from Solar Electronics, 156 Drakes Lane, Summertown, TN 38483. Bear in mind that a  geiger counter only measures the radiation from external sources such as nuclear power plant ventings, highway spills, or industrial and military exposure. The greatest danger comes from the radioactive cesium, strontium and plutonium atoms that you eat or breathe. These agents of death in your own body internally emit radiation that constantly bombards the genes of the nearby cells. This subtle (but perhaps more deadly radiation) from inside your body is not measured by a geiger counter unless you have breathed or eaten a substantial amount of radioactive material.
