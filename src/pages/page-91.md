## <span style="font-size:47px;">W</span>e must get behind emotional rigidity, intellectual jargon and logic-tight compartments of the mind.
## We must realize that there are no simple right answers.
## We must stop risking the survival of our planet by demanding that we always get our way. If we always get our way, there is no real negotiation.
## Together we must develop effective understandings based on bothe sides working together to create mutually acceptable solutions that we can all live with.
