## <span style="font-size:47px;">Y</span>ou have notices a distant, rumbling background sound. But what does it mean? You can see a mist in the air ahead of you. There's nothing alarming that seems to call for your immediate attention.

## And, besides, you are so busy guiding the raft and keeping it off the rocks that you don't want to think of anything else right now.

## Maybe the rumbling will go away....
