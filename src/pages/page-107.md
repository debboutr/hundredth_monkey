## <span style="font-size:47px;">A</span> stereo set is not the record it plays.
## If a record is scratchy, we don't throw out the stereo set. All we have to do is change the record.
## We don't have to reject a human being because we don't like his or her programming.
## We can just make it clear that we like the person -- but we don't like a particular action.
## And our thoughts and actions can change because they're not us -- in our essence.
