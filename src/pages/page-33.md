## <span style="font-size:47px;">I</span>f you're within a few miles of a nuclear detonation, you'll be incinerated on the spot!

## And if you survive the blast, what does the future promise?

## The silent but deadly radiation, either directly or from fallout, in a dose of 400 rems could kill you within two weeks.

## Your hair would fall out, your skin would be covered with large ulcers, you would vomit and experience diarrhea and you would die of infection or massive bleeding as your white blood cells and platelets stopped working.
