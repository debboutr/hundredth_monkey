## <span style="font-size:47px;">A</span> smaller amount of exposure sets you up for cancer in twelve or more years.

## Even a tiny invisible particle of plutonium is so radioactive that it can cause cancer or alter your genes so that your children may be deformed at birth!

## Plutonium has been called "thalidomide forever."

*Dr. John Gofman is the co-discoverer of uranium-233 and a leading medical researcher. In his 908-page book _Radiation and Human Health_ (Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, 1981) he tells exactly how radiation produces cancer, leukemia and birth defects. This book enables you to estimate diminished life-expectancy from various radiation exposures. It evaluates the genetic consequences to future generations of our current radiation exposures. This comprehensive book can be ordered from the Committee for Nuclear Responsibility, Box 11207, San Francisco, CA 94101 for $29.95 postpaid.
