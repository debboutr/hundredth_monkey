## <span style="font-size:47px;">W</span>hat are the signs and the scientific data that are so easy for us to ignore -- but which are giving us a clear warning of a certain catastrophe that lies ahead if we remain on our present course?*

*In 1954, actors John Wayne, Susan Hayward, Agnes Moorehead, and producer Dick Powell filmed "The Conqueror" on the sandy dunes outside St George, Utah. We had previously conducted a number of atomic bomb tests in Nevada about 150 miles away. For three months, the filmmakers were breathing the dust laced with radioactive plutonium fallout. Twenty-five years later John Wayne, Susan Hayward, Agnes Moorehead and Dick Powell had all died of cancer. Of the "220 people in the cast and crew, ninety-one had contracted cancer by late 1980, and half of the cancer victims had died of the disease." From _Killing Our Own_ by Harvey Wasserman and Norman Solomon, p. 81, Dell Publishing Company, Inc., 1982.
