## <span style="font-size:47px;">W</span>e are about to drown in nuclear sewage. We now have about one hundred million gallons of dangerous radioactive effluents that no one knows what to do with. And it's globally increasing at a catastrophic rate.

## There is no way to dafely dispose of this extremely dangerous, corrosive, radioactive garbage in leakproof containers that will be continuously protected by competent guards free from war, earthquakes, floods, and tornadoes for hundreds of thousands of years!

## What right have we to burden future generations with this ever-increasing threat to their well-being?
