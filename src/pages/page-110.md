## <span style="font-size:47px;">Y</span>our thoughts and actions are only a set of mental habits in a state of flux as you evolve from stage to stage of your life's growth.
## All of us have done mean, sloppy and uncaring things that we wish we hadn't done.
## I always hope that you won't identify me with the things that I've done that were unskillful responses to life situations.
