## <span style="font-size:47px;">D</span>aniel Ellsberg, who was an assisstant to former Secretary of Defense McNamara, reminds us of an accident in 1961 when an Air Force plane carrying a 24-megaton bomb crashed in North Carolina.
## On crash impact five of the six interlocking safety mechanisms failed!
## Only one switch kept the bomb from unleashing the equivalent of 1,000 Nagasake-type explosions!*
## We've been lucky so far!
