## <span style="font-size:47px;">N</span>uclear submarine workers at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, are developing cancer at a rate that is double the expected incidence.

## Dr. Helen Caldicott, author of _Nuclear Madness_, was invited to speak to a meeting of these workers, but only four men appeared.

## They told her that the Navy had threatened them with the loss of their jobs if they came to hear her talk.

## Are jobs more important than life itself?
