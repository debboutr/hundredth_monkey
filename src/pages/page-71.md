## <span style="font-size:47px;">"T</span>he war planning process of the past has become totally obsolete. ATTACK IS NOW SUICIDE," said Thomas J. Watson, Jr., former Ambassador to the Soviet Union and President of IBM.
## Watson warns us against:
> ### "...the illusion that we cannot sign treaties with the Russians because they systematically violate them.
> ### Let us be clear about this: there are major differences between our two countries. Soviet values are diametrically opposed to ours, Contention between us on a global scale is a fact of life. Suspicion is the keynote of our relations.
> ### But having said that, let me add this: on the evidence, the Soviets so keep agreements provided each side has an interest in the other's keeping the agreement, and provided each side can verify compliance for itself.*
*Keynote address at Harvard's 330th commencement on June 4, 1981.
