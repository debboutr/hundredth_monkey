## <span style="font-size:47px;">T</span>he problem I find in trying to go from the separate-self to the consciousness of my unified-self is that my ego operates under the illusory programming that in order to like or love you, I must like or love everything you do or say.
## I identify you with your thoughts or your actions.
## I lose sight of the fact that your thoughts and actions just reflect your life experiences and your training.
