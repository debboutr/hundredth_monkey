## <span style="font-size:47px;">W</span>hen I create my experience of you I may forget that you are not your thoughts or actions.
## I don't know you from inside -- as I experience myself.
## I may forget that in every important way you are like me.
## You have a human heart that feels pain and warmth, sadness and happiness.
## In your essence and in your intentions you are basically good -- just like me!
