We had previously conducted a number of atomic bomb tests in Nevada about 150 miles away. For three months, the filmmakers were breathing the dust laced with radioactive plutonium fallout. Twenty-five years later John Wayne, Susan Hayward, Agnes Moorehead and Dick Powell had all died of cancer. Of the \"220 people in the cast and crew, ninety-one had contracted cancer by late 1980, and half of the cancer victims had died of the disease.\" From <em>Killing Our Own</em> by Harvey Wasserman and Norman Solomon, p. 81, Dell Publishing Company, Inc., 1982.</p>","frontmatter":{"previous":"/page-26","next":"page-28","asterisk":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/page-27/"}}
