High levels of tritium, which the plant releases routinely, have also been detected in the Savannah River and in local milk and vegetation.... Dr. Karl Z. Morgan, former director of the Health Physica Laboratory at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Tennessee, notes that in 1969 the flesh of a deer taken from the plant site was discovered to have the equivalent of 2,250 millirems per year of cesium, or 90 times the EPA limit for a human.\" \"Nuclear County\" by Zachary Sklar, <em>Geo</em>, Vol. 3, p. 32, August, 1981.</p>","frontmatter":{"previous":"/page-41","next":"/page-43","asterisk":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/page-42/"}}
