LaRocque, United States Navy (retired), suggests that a nuclear war may be started by mechanical mishaps and electronic and personnel errors:</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>...one of our strategic submarines, the <em>George Washington</em>, rean right into a Japanese ship just a few months ago and sank it! That's one of our best missile submarines!...We lost two of our nuclear attack submarines that sank in the ocean and we don't know why to this day -- the <em>Scorpion</em> and the <em>Thresher</em>. And earlier this year one of our missiles was accidentally fired from Arkansas because a mechanic dropped a wrench...</h3>\n<h3>We've had several incidents where nuclear weapons have literally fallen out of airplanes, literally just fallen through the bomb bays. Probably the most interesting one is the one that fell out of a strategic bomber in the Carolinas some years ago...landed in Carolina in a swamp, and thay looked all over for that nuclear weapon. We haven't found it yet...*</h3>\n<p>*The Defense Department bought the land, put a fence around it, and now it's a nuclear safety area! From a talk given on October 31, 1981 at a Los Angeles symposium organized by Physicians for Social Responsibility and the Council for a livable world.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"previous":"/page-53","next":"/page-55","monkey_msg":""}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/page-54/"}}
