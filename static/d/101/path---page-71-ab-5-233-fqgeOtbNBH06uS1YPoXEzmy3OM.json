Soviet values are diametrically opposed to ours, Contention between us on a global scale is a fact of life. Suspicion is the keynote of our relations.</h3>\n<h3>But having said that, let me add this: on the evidence, the Soviets so keep agreements provided each side has an interest in the other's keeping the agreement, and provided each side can verify compliance for itself.*</h3>\n<p>*Keynote address at Harvard's 330th commencement on June 4, 1981.</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"previous":"/page-70","next":"/page-72","monkey_msg":" THE U.S.A."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/page-71/"}}
