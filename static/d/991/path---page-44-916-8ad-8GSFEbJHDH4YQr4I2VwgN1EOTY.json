Bernard Field, professor, M.I.T., and the editor-in-chief of the <em>Bulletin  of the Atomic Scientists</em> said,</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Sometime later in this decade, military plans which are being seriously discussed on both sides would lead to ... an immediate exchange ... in a nuclear war of something between 10,000 and 20,000 megatons each.</h3>\n<h3>The fallout in the United States would be total. That is to say, there would be no areas, really, that could escape. There would be lethat fallout covering the entire Soviet Union. Worldwide this would lead to something ... somewhere in the region of, let's say, 20 radiation units per capita everywhere on earth.</h3>\n<h3>And this I would regard as a situation whick we would all have to consider to be absolutely intolerable.</h3>\n<h3>And, therefore, it seems to me that we have no choice in the direction in which we have no choice in the direction in which we have to move. The problem that faces us is not whether nuclear disarmament is feasible, but how we can go about convincing our leaders. And, presumably, they will be convinced when all the people, or at least a majority of the people, of our countries are convinced of the unacceptability of the current course of events in which missile is piled on top of missile, in which weapon is piled on top of weapon, and in which doctrines concerning their use are being proliferated not only in the insane superpowers but in other so-called civilized counries as well.</h3>\n<h3>How are we going to convince ourselves that this is an intolerable direction, stop where we are, turn it around and eventually reduce these stockpiles ... ?</h3>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"previous":"/page-43","next":"/page-45","monkey_msg":" BUSINESS"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/page-44/"}}
