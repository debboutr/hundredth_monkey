The United States Department of Agriculture in <em>Food, The Yearbook of Agriculture 1959</em>, p. 118, reported that strontium-90 from the United States and Russian atomic bomb tests had scattered radioactive strontium-90 over the entire earth. It was first detected in animal bones, dairy products and soil in 1953. It is now in the bodies of all human beings regardless of their age or where they live. The <em>Bulletin of the Atomic Scienctists</em>, Vol. XVII, No. 3, p. 44, March 1962, stated that children growing up in the United States have about 6 to 8 times more strontium-90 in their bones than their parents.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"previous":"/page-42","next":"/page-44","monkey_msg":" FUTURE GENERATIONS"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/page-43/"}}
